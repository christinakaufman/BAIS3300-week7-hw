Description:
Create a webpage html form that includes a variety of required and option questions on student lifestyle at the University of Iowa. The form includes contact questions and questions on your typical study and lifestyle habits at Iowa.

Best Practice:

My website conforms to best practice because it includes inclusive language, designs, and styles. It's important that all websites enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion by being legiable, takes into consideration color blindness, is accessible, and easy to use.

One way I conformed my website to best practice is by using contrasting colors that support those who are colorblind. After reasearching, I found that using colors like shades of blue, reds, and greens would be best to use on the website. I stayed simple with my design and kept all font colors the same and just made specific attributes stand out on the website, like required questions and clickable buttons.

Another way to conform a website to best practice is by having legible font sizes and colors. I kept all my font colors in black in order for it to be easily read and I made sure headers and text were in easy-to-read font styles. I used Arial as the font as it's a great size, simple lettering, and easily legible.
